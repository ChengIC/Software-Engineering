# Algorithms (minimalist version)
- Repository for documenting self-learning algorithms. 
- Roadmap is referred from [Algorithms 4th Edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
- Coding practices are referred from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).

### Motivation
The textbook and online resources from [Princeton University](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) are too difficult for beginners, while the contents and roadmap are excellent. Therefore, I want to create a minimalist version for the beginners to practice with online coding quizes while still following the learning path of the textbook.
