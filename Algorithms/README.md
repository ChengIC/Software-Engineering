# Algorithms (minimalist version)
- Repository for self-learning algorithms with **minimalistic roadmap**. 
- Roadmap is referred from [Algorithms 4th Edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
- Coding practices are referred from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).


## I. Sorting 
### Metrics:
- **Stable Sort**: The relative order of equal elements is preserved.
- **In-place Sort**: It does not require additional memory for the sorted array.
- **Time Complexity**: the number of operations performed by the algorithm.
- **Space Complexity**: the amount of memory required by the algorithm.


- [ ] **Selection Sort** 
- From left to right, it swaps the minimum element to the leftmost position and moves the boundary between sorted and unsorted part of the array one element to the right. 
- In-place | Unstable sort | Time Complexity: O(n^2) | Space Complexity: O(1)

- [ ] **Insertion Sort** 
- From left to right, it inserts the current element to the correct position in the sorted part of the array. 
- In-place | Stable sort | Time Complexity: O(n^2) | Space Complexity: O(1)

- [ ] **Shell Sort** 
- It is a generalization of insertion sort. It uses a gap sequence to compare elements that are far apart and gradually reduces the gap size to sort the array. 
- In-place | Unstable sort | Time Complexity: between O(nlogn) and O(n^2) | Space Complexity: O(1)
