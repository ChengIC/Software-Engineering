# Software-Engineering
Repository for self-learning software engineering topics which are important for my current job as a developer. These topics include:
- **Topic 1: [Algorithms](./Algorithms/README.md)**
- **Topic 2: [Cloud Computing](./Cloud-Computing/README.md)**
- **Topic 3: [Concurrent and Parallel Programming](./Concurrent-and-Parallel-Programming/README.md)**
- **Topic 4: [Database Design](./Database-Design/README.md)**
- **Topic 5: [Design Patterns](./Design-Patterns/README.md)**
- **Topic 6: [Knowledge Graph](./Knowledge-Graph/README.md)**
- **Topic 7: [Object-Oriented Programming](./Object-Oriented-Programming/README.md)**
- **Topic 8: [Robust Programming](./Robust-Programming/README.md)**
- **Topic 9: [Software Testing](./Software-Testing/README.md)**

It is a collection of resources and my personal notes on the topics listed above. I will continue to update it regularly. All content and design are tailored to be ***beginner-friendly***. 

### Motivation
- Open source and documenting my learning process for software engineering topics, all of which are highly relevant to my current job as a machine learning developer. 
- The selection of these topics is inspired by the ***[MSc Software Engineering from University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-software-engineering)***, but I have reorganized and updated the content to suit the industrial needs and the latest technologies instead of sticking on the university's curriculum.
- The learning path is enriched with additional resources from various open courses, LeetCode, HackerRank, Reddit, YouTube, and more, broadening the scope beyond a single organization's materials.
